HOW TO BUILD ARDUINO ON YOUR FAVORITE PLATFORM


////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////

//// Steps for First Time Setup 


1. INSTALL DEVELOPMENT TOOLS

1a. On Windows, install Cygwin. It's downloadable from 
    www.cygwin.com or specifically: www.cygwin.com/setup.exe

** of the packages, begin with the defaults, and add:

+ svn - used for version control

+ make, gcc-mingw, and g++ - used to build arduino.exe
  (this will also pull in gcc-core)

+ perl - use this version, activestate or other distros have trouble
  
+ unzip, zip - for dealing with archives

+ included in the defaults, but make sure:
  coreutils (or textutils), gzip, tar

+ not required but useful: 
  openssh - command line ssh client
  nano - handy/simple text editor

** and be sure to leave the option selected for 'unix line endings' 

the cygwin installer is sometimes a little flakey, so it may take more 
than one try to get everything in there. in fact, it's often best to
run the installer once, and let it install all its defaults, then run 
it again, and select the items above. it's also useful to run the 
installer every few months to keep things fresh.


1b. On Mac OS X, install Apple's Developer Tools and subversion.

1c. On Linux, you're pretty much on your own.. You need jikes (or
    edit make.sh to use a different compiler), java, avr-gcc, make,
    and subversion.  You'll also have to set some environment
    variables (see make.sh for details).


2. GRAB THE CODE FROM BERLIOS

* this grabs the code as an anonymous user. 

# grab the code, it'll take a while
svn co svn://svn.berlios.de/arduino/trunk
# (maybe even a long while for you dialup and international folks)


3. BUILD IT

3a. On the Mac, use the Xcode project to build the Arduino software.
    Set the active target to App to run Arduino, or to Distribute to
    create a .zip file.

3b. On Windows or Linux, use the command line.

# on Windows
cd /path/to/arduino/build/windows

# or if you're on linux
cd /path/to/arduino/build/linux

# and then..
./make.sh

# if everything went well, you'll have no errors. (feel free to make
# suggestions for things to include here for common problems)

# then to run it
./run.sh

# each time you make a change, use make to build the thing 
# and run to get it up and running.

//// Updating to the Latest Version


4a. Each time you want to update to latest version from svn:

cd /path/to/arduino
svn update


4b. If new folders have been added, or you're gettin odd errors, use:

# remove the work directory
rm -rf work

$Id$
