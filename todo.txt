Add support for ATmega1280 (e.g. timers, external interrupts, multiple serial ports).
Add weak attribute to signal handlers: http://www.arduino.cc/cgi-bin/yabb2/YaBB.pl?num=1203798214
Incorporate ladyada's new SoftwareSerial library.
Good way to receive multiple values / complex messages over the serial port (Firmata?)

Way to print floats.
Should Serial.print(b) send the ASCII digits of the byte?

Add Ping example.
Switch to ServoTimer2 library?  http://www.arduino.cc/cgi-bin/yabb2/YaBB.pl?num=1222201226/0#5
Add ContinuousServo library that inherits from Servo?
LiquidCrystal library: support going to the next line with println().
Ethernet library:
 - call Server.begin() from Ethernet.begin() instead of in user's sketch?
 - add method for receiving notification of new client connections to a server
 - add method for receiving notification of data written to a client
 - add method for receiving notification of client disconnections
Supporting EEMEM directive by changing compiler command line: http://www.arduino.cc/cgi-bin/yabb2/YaBB.pl?num=1202157667
Include Arduino as AVR-ISP sketch in hardware/firmwares.
Move type definitions into WConstants.h.
Change core and libraries to use Arduino types (e.g. byte, boolean).
Fix millis() so it never increments by two.
Consider moving millis() to timer 1, and configuring it so the interrupt is generated once a millisecond.

COMPUTER

Check RAM usage of sketches: http://www.arduino.cc/cgi-bin/yabb2/YaBB.pl?num=1224729260/0#0
Improve preprocessing of sketches:
 - Better determine which header files are included (not commented out).
 - Remember the original locations of function prototypes to highlight the correct line on error.
Multiple sketch windows.
Easier library discovery and installation.
Easier board installation ("Add board..." menu item)
Comprehensive board management:
 - Enabled and disabled boards.
 - Dialog for enabling, disabling, adding, and deleting boards.
 - Board descriptions (e.g. explaining differences between boards).
Clean up Library and LibraryManager.
Detect dependencies between libraries.
Byte-based serial monitor.
Line termination options in the serial monitor.
Clear character should clear serial monitor.
Incorporate serial-net proxy.
Changing font size should change serial monitor font size.
Deal with shorter screens (e.g. ASUS EEPC).
Investigate method for auto-detecting serial port on Windows (javax.usb?)
Guess serial port on the Mac and Linux.
Automatic detection of baud rate for serial monitor (based on the call to Serial.begin() in the current sketch).
Improve, generally, the upload experience (e.g. faster program start after upload, keep-alive messages to bootloader from IDE, shorter bootloader timeout if possible, progress bar)
Generate .eep files for EEPROM variables (without warning when the EEMEM directive isn't used).
Allow uploading of .hex files.
Allow for arbitrary compilation command line arguments.
Find in reference should give same message for missing page as for missing page association.
Test find in reference on libraries.

DEVELOPMENT

Make run.bat not open a command line window: http://www.arduino.cc/cgi-bin/yabb2/YaBB.pl?num=1223883872
Update version of the FTDI drivers (Windows).
Remove AVR ISP and giveio drivers (Windows).
Include the executable installer for the FTDI drivers (Windows).
Include newer version of avr-gcc (one that supports the ATmega1280).
Revise fetch.sh to look for version specific pages (names suffixed with, e.g., "-0007")
If possible, install bug tracking and svn on arduino.cc.
Move to ant for build process.

DOCUMENTATION / SITE CONFIGURATION

Document Matrix and Sprite libraries on the Arduino site.
Documentation for moving from Arduino to custom PCBs.
Arduino feature list (in Getting Started > Introduction).
Programming tutorial for Arduino.
Write advanced library tutorial.
Better documentation of the Arduino BT.
Tutorial about serial communication.

DOCUMENTATION / REFERENCE

Remove parameters from the function links on the reference page.
